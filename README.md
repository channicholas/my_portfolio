# H20 Documentation

H20 is a machine learning package that can fit a lot of different kinds of ML models such as generalized linear modeling (linear regression, logistic regression, etc.), Naive Bayes, principal componets analysis, k-means clustering, and word2vec. H2O implements best-in-class algorithms at scale, such as distributed random forest, gradient boosting, and deep learning.
